      <h1>Why We Chose Simplicity</h1>
      <div class="meta">December 5, 2025</div>
      <p>Every product starts simple. Then features creep in, edge cases multiply, and before you know it, the thing that was easy to use isn't anymore.</p>
      <p>We decided early on that we'd rather say no to a hundred good ideas than say yes to one that makes the product harder to understand. That means fewer features, but the ones we ship are solid.</p>
      <p>Simplicity isn't the absence of effort — it's the result of it. Every screen, every label, every interaction has been questioned, tested, and often removed entirely.</p>
