      <h1>Year in Review: 2025</h1>
      <div class="meta">January 12, 2026</div>
      <p>2025 was our biggest year yet. We doubled our user base, shipped four major updates, and somehow kept the team small enough to fit around one table.</p>
      <p>The highlight was launching our API in March, which opened the door for integrations we never anticipated. By December, over two hundred teams had built on top of it.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead to 2026, we're focused on reliability and speed. No flashy features — just making what we have work even better.</p>
