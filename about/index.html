    <h1>About Minimal Co.</h1>
    <p>Minimal Co. was founded in 2020 with a single idea: less is more. We believe the best tools are the ones you barely notice — they just work.</p>
    <p>Our small team is spread across three time zones, united by a shared love of clean design and clear thinking. We skip the meetings that could be emails and the features that could be bugs.</p>
    <p>If that sounds like your kind of company, we'd love to <a href="/contact/">hear from you</a>.</p>
